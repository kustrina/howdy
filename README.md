## Workshops

With workshops, we would like to bring Angular 2+ closer to as many developers as possible. That's why we will have 3-month basic course (once per week). We will introduce all Angular related things that are necessary to start creating apps with Angular 2, not just Hello world :). After that we will switch to more advanced things and deep dives (once or twice per month). Workshops are for everyone; they are community driven and **completely FREE**. Workshops can be free, because of our sponsors who pay for space, food and drinks. Thanks again to all of them.

Maybe you've just heard of Angular or maybe you are a pro, everyone is welcome. Bellow you can see the schedule with topics, so you can choose which one suits you. If you just started I would suggest you attend every single one. If you have a suggestion for a topic, create an [issue](https://github.com/ng-slo/workshop/issues).

For all workshops, we will record theoretical part and upload slides. Recordings can be found on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV7pUIUwOPPZpTUJufxZNLg). Exercises from practical part will be uploaded into [workshop repository](https://github.com/ng-slo/workshop) with a solution for them. This way if you can't attend a workshop, you can do it at home and if you will have any questions you can ask them on the next workshop.
